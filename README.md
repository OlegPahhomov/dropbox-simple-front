# dropbox-simple-front

####### Goal
Creating a simple file upload and viewing platform using different languages and frameworks

####### Java Simple Front

To run:
* 1) You need server-side project part
* 2) I sort of open index.html in browser and enjoy :)
* 3) I think you could pack it up and put it to server


####### In more detail

html - js/jQuery - css - microtemplate.js - fancybox - jquery validation


This is front-end part of dropbox-java.
